## Objectives
### Short term (<2 months)
Incorporate NLP (likely token classification) so that the system is able to recognize important data. Over time use the user interactions and corrections to feed back into the model. Clean up UX,UI and release to the app store.
### Medium term (<6 months)
Have the table creation be as simple as proving 1 example speech and the subsequent data to be plugged in should accept different ways of saying the speech and it should be logged accurately. Allow it to be used globally on the phone.
### Long term and end goal
Effortless and hands free creation development of structured data paired with flexible API for customer use.

## Potential uses
- Engineer logging measurements with the data automatically being sent to whatever program they use with our API
- Person annotating timestamps or notes from a video to refer to later
- Teacher marking attendence and automatically updating the program.
